# üí∏ Dummy Token UI + Smart Contract

A simple dApp to connect your wallet, view your balance, and transfer a custom dummy token ‚Äî built in using a dummy token contract provided by Decentraland + Decentraland UI.

This repo includes both the UI and the dummy token contract to help you run everything locally faster üöÄ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Run the Token Contract Locally

### 1.1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd dummy-token-ui/dummy-token
npm install
```

### 1.2. Start the local Ethereum node

```bash
npx hardhat node --hostname 0.0.0.0
```
Keep this terminal open!

### 1.3. Deploy the contract

In another terminal:

```bash
npx hardhat --network localhost run scripts/deploy.js
```

Copy the token address printed in the console:

### 1.4. Use the faucet to add ETH and DUMMY tokens to your wallet

```bash
npx hardhat --network localhost faucet <token-address> <your-metamask-address>
```

‚úÖ Replace:

- `<token-address>` with the one from the previous step
- `<your-metamask-address>` with your wallet address
